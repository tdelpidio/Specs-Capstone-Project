Idea: My sister-in-law has celiacs disease and struggles to find restaurants that are gluten free and celiac friendly. I am creating a website where users can find and/or add gluten free restaurants and their experiences at these restaurants to help promote celiac awareness and also provide users with a sense of community and comfort when trying to dine out.

MVP:

Users can login and create an account
Has a database of users
Has a database of restaurants
Users can add restaurants to database
Users can rate and add comments/reviews to restaurants
Users can save restaurants to their profile
Users can search for restaurants by state
Future Features:

Ability to search for a restaurant by type of cuisine
Ability to message other users
Database of supermarkets and products that are gluten free
